# w3schoolsremover
Personal use chrome extension to hide w3schools from google search results

Quickly made to replace "W3Schools Hider" which suddenly wanted all browsing data without a changelog stating why  

Note this only works on .com and .nl TLD's because there doesn't seem to be a clear way to allow any
